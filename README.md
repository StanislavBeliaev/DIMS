### Publish with netlify button üöÄ

You need to have an account on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/Dev-incubator/DIMS-cra#CUSTOM_LOGO=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50695950941_526e15d2f1.jpg&DIMS_TITLE="Dims%20app")

If you click this button, it‚Äôll authenticate you in Netlify and you'll have to choose a repository name. <br/>
Netlify will automatically create a new repo for you that looks exactly like this one. <br/>
Next, it will build and deploy the new site on Netlify bringing you to the site dashboard when the build is completed.

### Env variables üìù

 - **CUSTOM_LOGO** - here you can pass a link to your app logo
 - **DIMS_TITLE** - here you can pass your app title

#### VSCode integration
For ESLint warnings inline with your code and run formatting automatically with Prettier in VSCode, we need to install:
 - **[ESLint](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint)** extension
 - **[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode)** extension
 - Edit **VSCode** settings.json to set up formatting on every file change or on every save
